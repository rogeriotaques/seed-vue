## Quick start

> üí° This is a very quick start guide. Check the [docs](https://rogeriotaques.github.io/seed-vue/?path=/docs/quick-start--page) for the detailed version.

Install via `Yarn`

```sh
$ yarn add seed-vue
```

or `NPM`

```sh
$ npm install seed-vue
```

Import to start using it.

```js
// e.g main.js or main.ts

import Vue from 'vue';
import SeedVue from 'seed-vue'; // the components
import 'seed-vue/dist/index.css'; // the styles
import App from './YourApp.vue';

Vue.use(SeedVue);

// or import on-demand with
// import { Button } from 'seed-vue';
// Vue.component(Button.name, Button);

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: (h) => h(App)
});
```


Use it on your templates.

```html
<!-- e.g. YourApp.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>
      <s-button color="primary" @click="clickHandler">
        Click to say hello!
      </s-button>
    </p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: 'YourApp',

    methods: {
      clickHandler(event) {
        console.log('CLICKED!', event);
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```
